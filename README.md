## <a name="usage"></a> Usage

To set up a Puppet Master service, simply include `recipe[puppet::master]`
in your run\_list, bam! See the [Attributes](#attributes) section for more
details on tuning the server.

## <a name="requirements"></a> Requirements

### <a name="requirements-chef"></a> Chef

Tested on 10.16.2 but newer and older version should work just fine. File an
[issue][issues] if this isn't the case.

### <a name="requirements-platform"></a> Platform

The following platforms have been tested with this cookbook, meaning that the
recipes run on these platforms without error:

* CentOS (6.5)
* ubuntu (12.04)

If you find this cookbook runs on other platforms/versions or you add support,
please file an [issue][issues]. Thank you!

### <a name="requirements-cookbooks"></a> Cookbooks

This cookbook depends on the following external cookbooks:

* [apt][apt_cb]
* [yum][yum_cb]

## <a name="installation"></a> Installation

Depending on the situation and use case there are several ways to install
this cookbook. All the methods listed below assume a tagged version release
is the target, but omit the tags to get the head of development. A valid
Chef repository structure like the [Opscode repo][chef_repo] is also assumed.

### <a name="installation-platform"></a> From the Opscode Community Platform

To install this cookbook from the Opscode platform, use the *knife* command:

    knife cookbook site install puppet

### <a name="installation-librarian"></a> Using Librarian-Chef

[Librarian-Chef][librarian] is a bundler for your Chef cookbooks.
To install Librarian-Chef:

    cd chef-repo
    gem install librarian
    librarian-chef init

To use the Opscode platform version:

    echo "cookbook 'puppet'" >> Cheffile
    librarian-chef install

Or to reference the Git version:

    repo="fnichol/chef-puppet"
    latest_release=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/$repo/git/refs/tags \
    | ruby -rjson -e '
      j = JSON.parse(STDIN.read);
      puts j.map { |t| t["ref"].split("/").last }.sort.last
    ')
    cat >> Cheffile <<END_OF_CHEFFILE
    cookbook 'puppet',
      :git => 'git://github.com/$repo.git', :ref => '$latest_release'
    END_OF_CHEFFILE
    librarian-chef install

### <a name="installation-berkshelf"></a> Using Berkshelf

[Berkshelf][berkshelf] manages a cookbook or an application's cookbook
dependencies, very similar to the [Bundler][bundler] gem.
To install Berkshelf:

    cd chef-repo
    gem install berkshelf
    berks init

To use the Community Site version:

    echo "cookbook 'puppet'" >> Berksfile
    berks install

Or to reference the Git version:

    repo="fnichol/chef-puppet"
    latest_release=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/$repo/git/refs/tags \
    | ruby -rjson -e '
      j = JSON.parse(STDIN.read);
      puts j.map { |t| t["ref"].split("/").last }.sort.last
    ')
    cat >> Berksfile <<END_OF_BERKSFILE
    cookbook 'puppet',
      :git => 'git://github.com/$repo.git', :branch => '$latest_release'
    END_OF_BERKSFILE

## <a name="recipes"></a> Recipes

### <a name="recipes-default"></a> default

This recipe is a no-op and does nothing.

### <a name="recipes-master"></a> master

Installs and configures a puppetmaster service.

## <a name="attributes"></a> Attributes

### <a name="attributes-master-conf"></a> master_conf

This hash maps directly into the configuration that will end up in the
`puppet.conf` file for a puppetmaster node. The keys under this hash
correspond to sections in a puppet configuration file and the data contained
within are the key/value pairs in that section. For example, an attribute

    node['puppet']['master_conf']['main']['logdir'] = '/var/log/puppet'

will create a **main** section with a **logdir** variable:

    [main]
    logdir = /var/log/puppet


See the attributes file for more example usage.

Ideally create a topic branch for every separate change you make.
